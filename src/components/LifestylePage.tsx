          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Morning Wakefulness</span><br />
          Within 10 minutes of waking, expose yourself to natural light—go for a walk outside, eat breakfast on your patio, or read by a sunny window. Seeing early sun helps set your circadian clock, boosts alertness and cortisol, and energizes your morning. Placing your alarm clock across the room can help you rise quickly and get that vital first dose of daylight.

          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Nutrition Habits</span><br />
          Refer to the Nutrition & Supplement tab for full details. I follow an 8‑hour eating window each day, focusing on whole foods—animal meats, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—and avoiding processed products. This approach fuels sustained energy, supports gut health, and reduces chronic inflammation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Physical Activity</span><br />
          The CDC recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate‑intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous‑intensity aerobic activity weekly. I build in daily low‑intensity movement—typically a walk at dawn or dusk—and aim for at least one higher‑intensity session each day, whether it’s gym work, running, swimming, or cycling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Connection & Purpose</span><br />
          Aim for one meaningful social interaction each day—take a friend for a walk, call a family member, or share a meal. These connections boost well‑being, strengthen relationships, and promote oxytocin release.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Focused Work & Scheduled Breaks</span><br />
          Work in concentrated blocks (e.g., 50 minutes), then pause to walk, hydrate, stretch, or do a quick set of push‑ups. Regular breaks sustain energy and productivity—many find they accomplish more with these micro‑pauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Environmental Detox</span><br />
          Choose non‑toxic cleaning and personal‑care products, and store food in glass or stainless‑steel containers. Avoid plastics—use glass water bottles and non‑plastic cookware, and opt for natural textiles (cotton, linen) over synthetic fabrics to minimize exposure to endocrine disruptors and “forever” chemicals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Evening Wind‑Down</span><br />
          Finish eating at least two hours before bedtime. Dim lights and put away screens 60 minutes before sleep; unwind with light journaling, a book, or gentle stretching. Consistency in your evening routine is key to restorative, high‑quality sleep.
